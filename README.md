# Gregory's Password Generator 

## Description

This random password generator was an incredibly fun project to create and work on. In an age where cyber security is of the upmost importance, it is paramount to use a wide variety of passwords across different platforms. If someone is like me, we tend to default to a handful of few different passwords that could easily be compromised. To fix this, I decided to create a random password generator that will ensure your security is never compromised. You are able to choose the length of the password, as well as what types of characters you would like to add (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). Even if someone chooses the exact same criteria repeatedly, they will never be given the exact same password. 

## Installation

There is no installation required, as this program functions entirely through a live website. 

## Usage

In order to use this program, the user simply clicks the generate password button a series of questions are prompted for the user to answer. Once answered, the program will spit out a randomly generated password based on the chosen critera.

## Credits

The function of this project was created soley by me, however the structure and design of the application is creditted to Xandromus.
